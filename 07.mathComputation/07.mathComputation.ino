  Learning Intention: The students will learn basic math and arithmetic operations
    1. I understand how a function is called
    2. I can break a simple program like LED blick into functions that I can be re-use
    3. I know the computation term 'abstraction.'
    4. I can create separate my functions into functions.ino files to make my code more manageable
    5. I can return values from a function and use the value in my code
    6. I can pass values into my functions to make them more secure
    7. I know the computation term encapsulation
