  Learning Intention: The students will learn how to connect and control a servo motor.
  Success Criteria:
    1. I understand how to connect the servo motor
    2. I can manually write different degrees of movement to the servo
    3. I can map a potentiometer to a servo and control its movement
    4. I understand that a 180deg servo angle of movement is set by a frequency signal sent from the microcontroller

  Student Notes:

//The Servo-h library is built into Ardunio IDE there is no need to side load it like the Ultrasonic Sensor library


void setup() {

}

// The loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop() {
