  Learning Intention: The students will learn how to wire two motors to an H-Bridge controller and control the motor's speed and direction.
  Success Criteria:
    1. I understand what an H-Bridge is and what it does
    2. I can fit the shield correctly to the Arduino
    2. I can manually write different directions and speeds to two motors
    3. I understand the advantages and disadvantages of a continuous servo over a motor and H bridge
    4. Understand the importance of only connecting an external battery when the Arduino is disconnected from the computer
